# Flikering-Night-Sky

Live DEMO coming soon!

An animation of night sky, with flickering stars

Star_writer code was used inorder to easily, quickly write over 200+ lines of jQuery.

It may appear that a simple "javascript for loop" in the actual run-script itself would suffice, although I encountered difficulties when executing it, and having it perform as I needed. Therefor Star_writer was written to automate the task of writting the 200+ jquery lines required, for each of the stars, and their flickering animation that appears.

Including that file here wasn't exactly necessary inorder to run the code, though I thought it could be useful & beneficial if you wanted to rewrite a large portion of the script, ie time delay and etc.



Star_writer

Technically, to my understanding, using code to write code... :P
